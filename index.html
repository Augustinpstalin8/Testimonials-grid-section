  <p class="small">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
  in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</p>

 <p class="big"> ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
  the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

<p class="small4"> Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
  learning from their experiences was easy.

<p class="big4">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>

  <p class="small5">  Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
  <p class="big5">‚ÄúBefore joinig the bootcamp,I've never writtena line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of thiers who can only say wonderful things about the program.The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project,in particular,was outstanding.It took my learning to the next 
    level in a way that no tutorial could ever have .In fact,I've often refrred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a jobas a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%recommmend!""
